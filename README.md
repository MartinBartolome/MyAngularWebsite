# PersonalWebsite

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.1.1.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

### GitHub Pages Build

To build specifically for GitHub Pages deployment:

```bash
npm run build:github-pages
```

This will build the project with the correct base href and output the files to the `docs/` directory.

## Automated Deployment

This project is configured with GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy to GitHub Pages when changes are pushed to the `main` branch. The workflow:

1. Installs Node.js and project dependencies
2. Builds the Angular application using the GitHub Pages configuration
3. Deploys the built application to GitHub Pages

The deployment workflow can also be triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
